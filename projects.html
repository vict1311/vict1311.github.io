                    Fiction Probes into Energy Communities</h5>
                <p class="text-start">
                    This is the preliminary title of my Master's thesis, which I am writing with my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmelie-christensen-bb1034258/">Emmelie Christensen</a>.
                    In this thesis, we are designing a hybrid digital board game in which players can engage in the many conflicts and dilemmas of energy communities.
                    We are using the Research through Design method by meticulously documenting our design choices throughout the process to gain knowledge of what we design and how.
                    Further, we will conduct a number of play sessions, which can serve as possibilities to probe players' perspectives on what is fair in energy communities.
                    In doing this, we hope to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Provide insights on how players experience the many dilemmas in energy commnunities, what they deem appropriate,
                            and thus be able to provide design insights relevant for energy communities and their digital energy platforms.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Generate knowledge on how we can use the hybrid digital boardgame format as a design fiction probe tool,
                            which can support multiple simultaneous participants, and thus be utilized to probe commons initiatives like energy communities.

                <p class="text-start">
                    This is a project I am currently undertaking with my friend and Bachelor's thesis partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobias-pedersen-bb26301a3/">Tobias Pedersen</a>!
                    In this project, we are working to understand what social media users on the Reddit subforum <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/botsrights/">r/botsrights</a> understand as the rights of bots.
                    This consists of two parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We have implemented a Python program which scrapes the Reddit subforum for submissions as well as their comments, while saving these in Excel.
                            This will provide us a dataset for our mixed methods analyses.
                            I am leading this part of the project, and you can find the Python program in <a href="I have lead the development of a Python program, which collects both posts on the subforum, as well as all replies to these posts.
                            Furthermore, the program saves all this in Excel sheets.">a GitHub repository</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We will use the collected data as the basis for a semantic network analysis and visual network analysis of Reddit submissions and comments.
                            In doing this, we will gain knowledge on how the subforum's users conceptualize what rights bots should have, to understand possible concerns among the public interacting with bots.
