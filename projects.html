                    Fiction Probes into Energy Communities</h5>
                <p class="text-start">
                    This is the preliminary title of my Master's thesis, which I am writing with my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmelie-christensen-bb1034258/">Emmelie Christensen</a>.
                    In this thesis, we are designing a hybrid digital board game in which players can engage in the many conflicts and dilemmas of energy communities.
                    We are using the Research through Design method by meticulously documenting our design choices throughout the process to gain knowledge of what we design and how.
                    Further, we will conduct a number of play sessions, which can serve as possibilities to probe players' perspectives on what is fair in energy communities.
                    In doing this, we hope to:
                    <ul class="text-start">
                        <li>
                            Provide insights on how players experience the many dilemmas in energy commnunities, what they deem appropriate,
                            and thus be able to provide design insights relevant for energy communities and their digital energy platforms.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Generate knowledge on how we can use the hybrid digital boardgame format as a design fiction probe tool,
                            which can support multiple simultaneous participants, and thus be utilized to probe commons initiatives like energy communities.
                        </li>

                <p class="text-start">
                    This is a project I am currently undertaking with my friend and Bachelor's thesis partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobias-pedersen-bb26301a3/">Tobias Pedersen</a>!
                    In this project, we are working to understand what social media users on the Reddit subforum <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/botsrights/">r/botsrights</a> understand as the rights of bots.
                    This consists of two parts:
                    <ul class="text-start">
                        <li>
                            We have implemented a Python program which scrapes the Reddit subforum for submissions as well as their comments, while saving these in Excel.
                            This will provide us a dataset for our mixed methods analyses.
                            I have been leading this part of the project, and you can find the Python program in <a href="I have lead the development of a Python program, which collects both posts on the subforum, as well as all replies to these posts.
                            Furthermore, the program saves all this in Excel sheets.">a public GitHub repository</a>, which I maintain.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We will use the collected data as the basis for a semantic network analysis and visual network analysis of Reddit submissions and comments.
                            In doing this, we will gain knowledge on how the subforum's users conceptualize what rights bots should have, to understand possible concerns among the public interacting with bots.

                    I started this work during my employment at <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/organisations/human-centered-computing">Human-Centered Computing</a>.
                    This project gave me my first major publication at CHI 2023, and there is still so much left to do!
                    Personally, I am working on providing further insights on not just what constitutes energy justice in energy communities,
                    but also what technologies available to us that can help enact energy justice.
                    I am also part of the final writing of the results from a workshop we held as part of the project.
                    All this very exciting stuff is happening in close collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rikke-hagensby-jensen-08701166/">Rikke Hagensby Jensen</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristina-laursen/?trk=public_profile_browsemap&originalSubdomain=dk&original_referer=">Kristina Laursen</a>!

                <h5 class="text-start">An Educational Game for Interdisciplinary Sustainability</h5>
                <p class="text-start">
                    I was hired at the Centre on Sustainable and Digital Transformation at Aalborg University's Department of Planning for a project
                    focused on continuing and finalizing the development of an educational game for use by the research center. 
                    This is based on a card game concept that has been somewhere around a year in development.
                    In the game, players try to discuss how different perspectives on sustainability complement and challenge each other, so they can construct productive visions of sustainable futures.
                    My primary focus in this project is twofold:
                    <ul class="text-start">
                        <li>
                            Digitalizing the game is a relevant component to provide both a platform for prototyping, as well as for remote cooperation.
                            I have helped to investigate 12 digital card game platforms, choose a specific one, and we are now implementing the game digitally.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The visual design of the card game has been rough, and as we are moving towards a final prototype, we are also aiming to put the game into small-scale production.
                            I have redesigned the layout of the cards, designed card backs, and am also going to be a part of designing the physical packaging of the product.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
