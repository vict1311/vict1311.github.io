                  My name is Victor, a student in Denmark both studying and working on how we can design for future technologies in responsible ways.
                  I have a Bachelor of Science in Techno-Anthropology, and am currently writing my thesis for a Master of Science in IT Design and Application development.
                  My interests are concerned with ethics in and of technology development, designing future technologies, as well as qualitative and quantitative studies of Human-Computer Interaction.
                  On this website, you can read a little about what I do, why I do it, and what I am currently working on.

                    I have spent a lot my working life (as well as all of my undergraduate and graduate studies) at Aalborg University (AAU).
                    Here, I have had the fortunate opportunity to work with research administration at the <a href="https://www.team.vbn.aau.dk/">VBN team</a>,
                    Human-Computer Interaction at the <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/organisations/human-centered-computing">Human-Centered Computing research group</a>,
                    as well as educational game design at the <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/organisations/centre-on-sustainable-and-digital-transformation">Centre on Sustainable and Digital Transformation</a>.
                    Further, I have close relations to some of the people in the <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/organisations/tekno-antropologi-participation">Techno-Anthropology and Participation research group</a>.
                    I have gotten to know plenty of great people during this work, as well as during my studies in Techno-Anthropology and IT Design and Application Development.
                    I am looking forward to applying my skills in the professional workforce, to hone both my analytical abilities as well as my software engineering skills!
